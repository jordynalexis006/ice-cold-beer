# Brainstorm
1. Player can use analog sticks on gamepad to emulate arcade joysticks
2. We want to come up with a mouse and keyboard control scheme for players without gamepads!
3. Could work as a mobile game? What would be the controls?
4. How can I customize the theme to not make it about beer?
David wants us to make a first playable prototype as a top priority! Before we get carried away with art and story stuff
